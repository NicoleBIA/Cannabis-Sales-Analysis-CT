INSERT INTO dbo.CannabisSales (MonthEnding, ProductType, RetailSalesAmount, Market)
VALUES

-- ✅ Validation Queries

-- 📌 Check total sales
SELECT SUM(RetailSalesAmount) AS TotalSales FROM dbo.CannabisSales;

-- 📌 Ensure all distinct product types were inserted correctly
SELECT DISTINCT ProductType FROM dbo.CannabisSales;

-- 📌 Check row count after insertion
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRows FROM dbo.CannabisSales;

-- 📌 Validate that all products have been assigned a CategoryID
SELECT * FROM dbo.CannabisSales WHERE CategoryID IS NULL;

🛠 **Debugging Notes:**
- `MonthEnding` was originally formatted as `"25-Jan"` and was standardized to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- The `ProductType` column was **standardized and mapped** to the `ProductCategory` table.
- Missing `CategoryID` values were identified using `SELECT * FROM dbo.CannabisSales WHERE CategoryID IS NULL;`, resolved with `UPDATE` queries.
- Queries were **cross-verified using Excel comparisons** before final validation.

### **📌 Next Steps**
1️⃣ **Perform deeper sales analysis by Market Type (Adult Use vs. Medical).**  
2️⃣ **Break down sales trends over time.**  
3️⃣ **Analyze total revenue and product performance per category (`analysis_queries.sql`).**  
4️⃣ **Prepare data for visualization in Power BI and Tableau.**
